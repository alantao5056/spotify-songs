My name is Alan Tao, and this website is a project I made in [Kane's Free Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/). I'm really interested in music in general, so I decided to focus my project on this topic. There are over 40 unique plots on this website, and it took me a long time to create.
