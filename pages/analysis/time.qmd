## Data Methodology

The following plots come from a dataset I found in Kaggle, called [Top Hits Spotify from 2000-2019](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paradisejoy/top-hits-spotify-from-20002019){target="blank"}. It contains 2000 songs on Spotify from 2000 to 2019, although there were also some songs from 1999 that I included. It contains multiple different variables for each song, such as the ones listed in the "Home" page.

## Plots

This line graph shows the number of **top** songs for various genres. This could be used to determine popularity because the graph was produced using the top songs for each year. We can see that Dance/Electronic songs became popular at around 2010, and pop songs stayed well above other songs. 

### Percentage of Explicit Top Spotify Songs From 1999 to 2019
