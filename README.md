## Introduction
My name is Alan Tao, and this website is a project I made in [Kane's Free Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/). I'm really interested in music in general, so I decided to focus my project on this topic. There are over 40 unique plots on this website, and it took me a long time to create. How did music evolve over time? What makes music popular? What defines a musicâ€™s genre? This project explores these questions with music data from Kaggle. They are accurate because they mostly all come from the Spotify API.
